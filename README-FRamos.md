## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Day 1 07/13/22
  â€¢Implemented Semantic HTML Structuring

  Notes for consideration: 
    The main changes between screen views is the background image and the size of the box.

Day 2 07/25/22
  Worked on: 
  â€¢formating Semantic HTML Structures - editing spacing and color
  â€¢Media Queries

  Notes for consideration:
    â€¢Media Queries have been implemented and are cropped once the browser width reaches ~1200px

    â€¢When formatting the 'plan-summary' div use grid format and seperate the elements into 3 different divs: 1 for the icon, 1 for the annual plan & price text and 1 for the change icon

    **REMINDER** the order of this 'plan-summary' element will not change, but the width of its cells could

    â€¢Revisit the Media Queries rules - should the mobile view extend until 1440px? then enter desktop?

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

Dealing with matching border radius' between images and their divs
On previous attempts, I've tried finding a way to use css object-fit and background-fit rules to try and crop an image so that it doens't exceed its parent containers. But when a border radius is implemented the img shoots past the border of its parent div - therefore, by implementing the border-top-xx-radius rules I can match the border-radius between an image and its parent container
```html
<section class="order-card">
  <div class="image-header">
      <img src="images/illustration-hero.svg" alt="Illustration">
  </div>
</section>
```
```css
.order-card
{
    border-radius:25px;
}
.image-header img
{
    border-top-left-radius: 25px;
    border-top-right-radius: 25px;
}
```
